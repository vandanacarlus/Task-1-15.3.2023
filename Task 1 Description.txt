Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP1 :1.loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
It need IP and port
It take time to load the page because it doest have binary protocal
It has drawbacks
HTTP2 :It able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
It need only IP
HTTP2 is best and Secure compare to HTTP1
Binary protocols consume less bandwidth, are more efficiently parsed , less time and are less error-prone
